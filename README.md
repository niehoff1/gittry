## This is a project description file for MATH 348 Art Create Project:
## Team members: Isaac Tjandra, Irina Beshentseva, Mart Niehoff, Minh Pham.
## Emails: tjandra1@kenyon, beshentseva2@kenyon.edu, niehoff1@kenyon.edu, pham2@kenyon.edu.
Develop a program that allows users to search for artworks with very specific 
categorization terms and create a composite image out of the search image and 
the user can click on different aspects of the composite image and it takes 
the viewer back to the original piece that the aspects originated from.
## Overarching goal: A new dialogic and expansive way for the users to interact with the database.
Task for next meeting: Read the MAGNet article on the class' website and single
out the different parts of the MAGNet project that we can reuse for our project.
Propose how we can reuse those parts.
